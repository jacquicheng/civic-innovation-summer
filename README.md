Civic Innovation Summer
=======================

Civic Innovation Summer is a 5-week program of civics, media, and technology training for teens conducted in the summer of 2013 in Chicago, IL.

This repository contains detailed instructions on how to implement this program anywhere. It contains day-by-day/ hour-by-hour notes on logistics, links to complete curriculum for download, and descriptions of how in-the-moment engagement with the youth led to changes in the program.

##Program Components

The program is broken down into three portions, run by three different organizations and formed into one cohesive summer experience.

1. **ChangeMakers**: an experience that provides youth with the tools and training they need to be powerful and thoughtful citizens and leaders. This portion has 100 teens and is run by the [Mikva Challenge](http://www.mikvachallenge.org/summer/) and it runs five days a week.
2. **DocuMakers**: an experience that provides youth the opportunity to develop and practice skills in media and technology, as they produce engaging media stories that highlight important activities taking place amongst the youth in Chicago. This portion has 40 teens is run by [Free Spirt Media](http://www.freespiritmedia.org/) and it runs five days a week. 
3. **OpenMakers**: an experience that provides youth with concrete tools and conceptual thinking around open technology. This portion brings all 140 teens in the program together weekly on Friday mornings and is run by the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/).

##Setup

There are a number of pieces of software we're using to manage this program:

1. **Google Groups**: we use a private Google Group to manage communication among the project team
2. **Github**: we use [Github](https://github.com/smartchicago/civic-innovation-summer/) to document how we create and implement the program. The hope is that people anywhere can fork this repository and localize it. Civics, media, and technology intersect no matter where you go. Teaching teens how to use these powerful forces to build careers and make lives better is a good idea anywhere.
2. **Instagram**: we use [Instagram](http://instagram.com/) to manage the creative output of the teens. Each program participant has an Instagram account and indicates when they've completed a portion of their summer work with Instagram posts.
3. **Twitter**: we use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) as a secondary element in the creative output workflow.
4. **Wufoo**: we use [Wufoo](http://www.wufoo.com/) to create forms to manage info about the participants and use it to modify curriculum and other project elements
5. **Slideshare**: all final curriculum will be published as PDFs and uploaded to [Slideshare](http://www.wufoo.com/)
